# Models Directory

This directory is used to store trained machine learning models in **`.pkl`** format. These files are ignored by **Git** for convenience, ensuring that the repository remains lightweight.

### 📂 Expected Model Files

- `logistic_regression.pkl`
- `random_forest.pkl`
- `svm.pkl`
- `xgboost_iteration_3_optuna_threshold_0.41.pkl`

### 📝 Note

Make sure to version control your models carefully if you plan to deploy them or share with collaborators.
